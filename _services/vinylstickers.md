## How to put vinyl stickers on vehicles.

Applying vinyl stickers yourself can give you satisfaction only if you allow yourself time to do it slowly and carefully. You may also wish to ask a friend to help if your vinyl stickers are large. 

## Step 1

Decide where you want your vinyl stickers to be placed. You can use a piece or two of low-tack masking tape to hold it in place. Do not use a stronger tape than this, or you risk possibly causing damage to your paint.

## Step 2

Adjust the placement of your decal as needed. Once you have finalized your placement, use a ruler to check the alignment of your vinyl sticker.

## Step 3

Dampen a clean, non-shedding cotton cloth with soapy water and thoroughly wash the area. Dry the area.

## Step 4

Apply the vinyl sticker according to your markings. Peel off the back paper, and be careful not to get fingerprints on the adhesive side of the sticker if it involves clear vinyl.

## Step 5

Smooth the sticker with the plastic squeegee, moving from the center to the outside of the decal to push out any air bubbles. Repeat this step until you get all the air out.

## Step 6

Poke tiny holes in any remaining air bubbles with a pin. And you're all done!
